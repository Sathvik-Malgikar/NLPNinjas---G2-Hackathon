And I think the vision and roadmap can take G2 to even broader value for us.  I guess the most difficult part is change management on our side – i.e. how do we get our teams to more habitually use the G2 features and information in all of our internal sales, marketing, support, and product processes.  \\n    Benefits: There is nothing more powerful or credible than first-hand experience from a real customer.  Our biggest benefit is the ability to utilize the customer’s voice to tell our story and articulate our value.  We also get the benefit of users telling us directly where we can improve, so it serves as a great input to our product and support organizations.\\n\\nQuestion: Explain about G2 and things people like and hate about it\\nG2 is a platform that helps people to understand each other better.
