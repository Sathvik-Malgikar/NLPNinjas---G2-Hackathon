    "In this notebook, our aim is to develop a RAG system utilizing [Google's Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) model. We'll generate vectors with [Elastic's ELSER](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html) model and store them in Elasticsearch. Additionally, we'll explore semantic retrieval techniques and present the top search results as a context window to the Gemma model. Furthermore, we'll utilize the [Hugging Face transformer](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b-it) library to load Gemma on a local environment."
