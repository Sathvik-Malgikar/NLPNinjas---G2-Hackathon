All prospects will eventually ask for references prior to making a purchase.  As our business unit is growing quickly, this can often cause reference fatigue as they are hit up over and over again.  Plus, IMO the reference process isn\'t perfect anyway for the prospect, as they will be biased.  So instead, we have our salespeople just point their prospects to G2Crowd instead.  ""Instead of me giving you the names of my 5 best customers, why don\'t you go to G2Crowd instead?  There you\'ll find verified reviews of actual users (not analysts that have never used the tools themselves), of our solution as well as our competitors.  And then from there you can do as many backdoor references as you\'d like.""  \r\n\r\nThis is win/win.  The prospect gets better reviews from users, that aren\'t prepped or set up....and we get our reference checks.

Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. \r\n\r\nReview generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nBuyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.\r\n\r\nG2 is a tool I use every day so it's something I need to work well all the time.
